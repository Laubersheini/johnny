Simulation of a von neumann arcitecture

The programm is hosted by inf-schule.de
https://inf-schule.de/content/7_rechner/3_johnny/johnny2/

With the hosting at inf-schule it does take some time for them to apply new version and bugfixes. As such there is also a Github page at:
https://laubersheini.github.io/johnny
which automatically updates as soon as i make a commit to the master branch of this repo so it should always be more up to date.
